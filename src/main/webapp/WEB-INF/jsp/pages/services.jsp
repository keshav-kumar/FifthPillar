	        <h4>House Building Material:</h4>
	        <img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/House Building Materials.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>Panchwa Stambh will take up the initiative of facilitating the access of people living in remote areas for the materials required in house building like cement, rods, bars. It will enter into tie-ups with distributors who will ensure the lowest market price. People will place the order via service center from where the order will be passed to the distributor to deliver the ordered items. The people of these villages do not have to travel to cities individually for buying these materials. Villagers will also get the advantage of the fair price.</p>
	      </div>
	    
	      <div class="fl_left">
	        <h4>Grocery items:</h4>
	        <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Grocery Items.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>Due to non availability of adequate quantity and variety of grocery items in the remote areas , the local people have to face a lot of difficulties in meeting personal as well as event based demands like marriages and other social gatherings. So, to reduce the personal travel expenses incurred and other difficulties, Panchwa Stambh will facilitate by having tie-up with whole-sale sellers to deliver the items to the buyer. Placing order through the service centre will make it easier for the people to fulfil their needs with ease and at comparatively lower prices.</p>
	      </div>
	    
	      <div class="fl_left">
	         <h4>Facilitation centers for insurance & investment:</h4>
	        <img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Facilitation Centers for Insurance & Investment.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>A major problem that our country faces is the proper financial inclusion of people from the rural areas due to inadequate reach of financial institutions and lack of awareness & knowledge. People are unable to enjoy the benefits of attaining growth of their money by storing/investing them with the financial institution. Many times intermediaries of various companies/banks misguide people and their investments end-up in loss, hence they feel cheated. People also fall in the everlasting debt traps due to borrowing from unregulated moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest. Panchwa Stambh, therefore, has a plan of helping people by acting as an intermediary (investment, loan, & policy advisor) who will guide and help in availing policies, investing in right place and in availing loans. Panchwa Stambh will thus help the people in attaining better financial health and also protect them from unfortunate events.</p>

	        <h4>Telemedicine centers:</h4>
	        <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Telemedicine Centers.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>The rural people again face a lot of problems in accessing proper health facilities. Healthcare expenses are going up and to add to that, the villagers have to spend extra amount of money in travelling to the cities, even to have access to basic healthcare facilities. This can be prevented with the presence of some persons who can be trained by the doctors for the basic ailments like common cold, fever, headache, loose motions, etc. Moreover, the patients will be inspected by the doctors by using technological facilities like video calling. For all these facilities, patient will be charged a nominal fee, which will be insignificant vis-a-vis the benefits for the people. Regarding the medicines, it will be advised to the doctors to prescribe only generic medicines, which again will be stocked by our centers, so that the people can buy from us without having to travel to the cities. In the case doctor find a patient with a severe problem/disease, he/she may call to his/her hospital/clinic for further investigation and treatment.</p>

	        <h4>Jewellery items:</h4>
	        <img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Jwelarry Items.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>Jewellery items are one of the costly items which the rural people lack access to. Moreover, they also get cheated by some unbranded jewellery dealers. To prevent this, Panchwa Stambh aims to tie-up with some reliable jewellery dealers, and hence acts as an intermediary to ensure quality and ease of access for the rural people for a nominal fee.</p>
	      </div>
	    
	      <div class="fl_left">
	        <h4>Extension centre of Banks:</h4>
	        <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Extension Centre of Banks.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>There are many banks in India with a significant reach, but when it comes to rural areas, the reach drops sharply and the reasons cited is absence of financial feasibility due to low volume and frequency of transactions. But to ensure the holistic growth of our country, we have to gradually bring an end to the negligence of the rural areas. Therefore, Panchwa Stambh aims to approach the banks of the country to use the service centres as their extension centre which will have some basic facilities like deposit/withdrawal of money in limits, and for some small loans, with the help of our service centers. Service centersâ€™ personals will be trained to operate the requisite banking facilities.</p>

	      <div class="fl_left">
	        <h4>LPG Distribution:</h4>
	        <img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/LPG Distribution.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>The distribution of LPG in our country is still limited to the city and it is out of reach to the villagers. For this reason, the rural people are still depended on the wood fire. Due to this, a very large section is deprived of the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. The fifth column is an attempt to tie up the LPG distributors to distribute the LPG to the rural areas. This facility will be made available to the people through Panchayat Service Centers.</p>

	        <h4>Public Services</h4>
	        <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Public Services.jpg" alt="">
	        <p>Panchwa Stambh can provide services like helping the villagers to lodge complaints and FIRâ€™s in local police stations or availing other public services. Often a person from the village has to face problems in order to avail the benefits of any government policies, schemes, and issuance of government certificates followed by a delay in the process. We can help them by taking all these initiatives on their behalf and help in smoothing the process. We will arrange frequent meetings with the authorities and update them of the status of ground work.</p>

		        <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/General Public Services.jpg" alt="">
		        <p>Panchwa Stambh can help in fastening the process of public works by acting as a liaison between the government agencies (municipal, blocks, etc.) and the villages. The priority would be to solve basic infrastructure issues like transformer repair work, public repair work. Also, the team can help in public works like plantation of trees, and solve basic sanitary issues like construction of toilets, cleaning of roads and public places. We will arrange frequent meetings with the authorities and update them on the status of ground work.</p>

		        <img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Blood Mitra.jpg" alt="">
		        <p>Panchwa Stambh will create a database of the interested bood donors with their details like blood group, address, and contact. During any medical emergency, available donor will be called to donate blood. This will minimize the problem of shortage of blood needed during a medical emergency.</p>

		        <h4>Information Services:</h4>
		        <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Information Centers.jpg" alt="">
		        <p>The service center will be a good way to get information. Whether, it is the government to get any kind of data or police to get any kind of information. Many times, in the absence of correct information, people are being cheated even in case of marriage. Sometimes, due to wrong information or rumors, a good relationship couldnâ€™t get materialized. Apart from this, these centers will also be useful.</p>

	      	  <div class="fl_left">
		        <h4>Labor Welfare:</h4>
		        <img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Labour Welfare.jpg" alt="">
		        <p>Even today, the unemployment rate is that laborers go to the city to do wages from the villages and there are some places (intersections, etc.) in the city/town where people are waiting to be invited to work. Many workers are in the hands of the broker, and they have to pay some of their wages to these brokers. Many times the workers from the far-flung villages have to return empty hands if they do not get work. Many times they do not even get wages in return for work, or they have to follow for several days. Apart from this, most of the laborers do not even have the government license, due to which they do not get the benefit of government schemes. With the solution of all these problems, the Panchwa Stambh will make such arrangements that the workers will get information about where to work from the service center in advance. Anyone who needs a laborer can contact the helpline number issued. The fifth column will do the government registration of all laborers through their service centers and help them in gaining the benefits of the government schemes.</p>

      			<img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Education.jpg" alt="">
      			<p>In the long run if there is one solution to practically all problems, it is education, more especially its quality, which is one of the most neglected things in this country. Education builds up character, imparts knowledge, hones thinking skills, refines our emotions, and provides skills that make one employable. For having an idea of my work on education, it may be useful to view the pictures and news clips in the gallery section, Though we have been working mainly with the underprivileged children for carrying our my educational experiments, a holistic alternative curriculum and an alternative pedagogy have evolved in the process that can help all age groups and all classes of children.</p>

      			<h4>Poverty Alleviation:</h4>
      			<img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Poverty Alleviation.jpg" alt="">
      			<p>It is a great shame for a country, which has all along been the most prosperous country of the world in the ancient and the mediaeval period, to be now ranked among the poorest countries of the world, and to be home to the largest number of the extremely poor population on earth. We have been researching on the phenomenon of poverty trying to find ways that could cure this disease in a few yearsâ€™ time - at least of some of the poorest states of India. We have prepared a 300-page project report way back in 2008-09 on a new poverty alleviation strategy and also a 50-minute documentary in English, and another in Hindi, to convince the political and bureaucratic leadership, who have no time or inclination to read long documents. Unfortunately, we discovered that our bureaucratic and political leadership in more interested in removing their own poverty, and seem to have no interest in removing the poverty of the teeming millions of India. So finally a Panchwa Stambh was formed to acquire the position that would enable us to implement the programme.</p>

      			<h4>Center of Spirituality:</h4>
      			<img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="/images/Offered Services/Center of Spirituality.jpg" alt="">
      			<p>Every panchayat center will have a place for religious and spiritual instruction mainly through instructional films; a Total Education Centre; a Livelihood Solution Centre; a small library and a wellness centre. The center of spirituality is a place where people will be lifted to a higher level of thought, faith and behaviour, and all communities and religions will be helped through total education, health services and self-employment training with assistance for removal of poverty with the help of a Livelihood Solution Centre. A Center of Spirituality is intended to be a holistic development centre for the entire area of the Panchayat that it will cater to. The center will facilitate in distributing the true version of our holy granth (Bhagwat Gita, Kuran, Bible, etc.) consciously free of cost or at nominal charges, which will help people in true practicing of Dharma.</p>
